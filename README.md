A personal backup of my user configurations using GNU Stow to distribute and manage symlinks across multiple environments. This setup enables my nefarious habit of reinstalling a fresh OS/distro every few months/weeks. Now, whenever my OCD gets the better of me, I don't have to spend half my day painstakingly reconfiguring the new environment; I can get back to productivity within minutes!
